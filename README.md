👋 Hello, I'm ANIKET INGALE!

🚀 DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure as Code | Automation Advocate

🌟 Passionate about streamlining software development and operations through automation and infrastructure as code. With a strong background in DevOps practices, I specialize in building robust and scalable systems that enable continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

💻 I have expertise in various DevOps tools and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, and AWS. From designing efficient CI/CD pipelines to managing cloud infrastructure, I thrive in creating reliable and efficient solutions that accelerate software delivery.

🔧 Automation is at the heart of my work. I believe in automating repetitive tasks, ensuring reproducibility, and reducing manual efforts. By leveraging infrastructure as code principles, I aim to treat infrastructure as software, enabling version control, rapid provisioning, and efficient management.

🧠 I stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the DevOps world, constantly learning and exploring new technologies to enhance development workflows and operational efficiencies. I'm particularly interested in topics like container orchestration, serverless architecture, and monitoring and observability.
